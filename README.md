forest_neural
=============

In order to compile this project, run the following command on the terminal

> g++ stats.cpp ann.cpp data.cpp -o [NAME] -O3

the -O3 is very important, or the code will run very slowly, and is not to be confused with -03.

this project comes with the data file required, and will generate lots of temporary files which will not go away after
the program exits.
